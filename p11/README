------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Download and Install CMake
------------------------------------------

CMake is a cross-platform build system that you can get from here:

http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

If you're on Ubuntu, don't bother with the web site; just type this:

   > sudo apt-get install CMake

You might be thinking "Oh no, not another build system!!"  Don't get your panties in a wad.
CMake is lightweight and popular; it's used in big-shot packages like Blender, KDE, and Boost.
It generates makefiles or project files for IDE's like Visual Studio and Xcode.

------------------------------------------
Step 2 - Choose Your Own Adventure
------------------------------------------

Open a command prompt and perform the following steps, depending on your platform:

VISUAL STUDIO 2010:

   > mkdir Build
   > cd Build
   > cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 10"  
   > glsw.sln
   > Right-click "glsw" in Solution Explorer and make it your StartUp Project.
   > Press F5
    
If you're using an older Visual Studio, just run "cmake" (no arguments) to see a list of options.
For example, a 2005 project can be built like this:

   > cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 8 2005"

LINUX OR MAC:

   > mkdir Build
   > cd Build
   > cmake ..
   > make
   > ./glsw

IF YOU WANT TO DEBUG WITH GDB:

   > mkdir Build
   > cd Build
   > cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   > make
   > gdb glsw
   > break Main.cpp:7
   > run

------------------------------------------
Step 3 - Testing
------------------------------------------

After successfully building everything, you can do this from the Build folder:

   > make test

Alternatively:

   > ctest
   
If you want to run only those tests that contains the string "Shader":

   > ctest -R Shader

The "Shader" in the above example is actually a full-blown regexp.

You can also enable verbose output like this:

   > ctest -R Shader -V
