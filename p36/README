Step 1 - Download and Install CMake
------------------------------------------

Before you scream "Oh no, not another build system!!", let me just say that CMake is lightweight, cross-platform, and well-worn; it's used in popular packages like Blender, KDE, and Boost.  It doesn't just generates makefiles, it generates *project files* which you can open with IDE's like Visual Studio and Xcode.

You can get it from here:

   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

If you're on Ubuntu, don't bother with the web site; just type this:

   > sudo apt-get install CMake

------------------------------------------
Step 2 - Choose Your Own Adventure
------------------------------------------

Open a command prompt and perform the following steps, depending on your platform:

VISUAL STUDIO 2010:

   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 10"  
   > PezPackage.sln
   > Right-click "PezPackage" in Solution Explorer and make it your StartUp Project.
   > Press F5
    
If you're using an older Visual Studio, just run "cmake" (no arguments) to see a list of options.
For example, a 2005 project can be built like this:

   > cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 8 2005"

LINUX -OR- MAC FROM COMMAND LINE:

   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake ..
   > make
   > ./PezPackage
 
MAC WITH XCODE:

   > cmake . -G "Xcode"
   > open PezPackage.xcodeproj
   > Press Command + Enter

IF YOU WANT TO DEBUG WITH GDB:

   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   > make VERBOSE=1
   > gdb PezPackage
