For the text art, I used "Jacky" from http://patorjk.com/software/taag/.

Should Pez initialize GLEW on your behalf?  If possible, no; although it should probably initialize "wglew" or whatever.

# Should Pez get its own entry? Could use Mobius or granny knot as a "simplest possible" demo. No PNG or LIBCTM or LZMA or ZLIB. No vectormath either! Includes "Builds" for everything.

    * The demo should definitely use ANSI C, to make sure Pez still works with it.
    * We should publish both entries simultaneously.
    * Should test with iPad
    * Should test mouse handlers even though the simple program won't use them.
